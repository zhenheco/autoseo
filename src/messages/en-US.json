      "getMoreCredits": {
        "question": "How can I get more Credits?",
        "answer": "You can purchase Credit top-up packages anytime, which are added directly to your account balance. If you want more monthly quota, you can also purchase another lifetime plan - the new plan's monthly quota will stack with your existing quota."
